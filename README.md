## Description

The culmination of Project 2, which required us to build full-stack web applications, marks another milestone in our journey to being web developers. Suffice it to say, updating our portfolio and other professional materials is not only a requirement, since we have new projects to share and showcase, but also good practice that builds toward being employer-competitive. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community, and having a place to share our projects is *necessary* if we're applying for jobs, and *critical* on our journey as a developer.

This README pertains to the following submissions: 

* Updated portfolio (dubbed Codefolio because it is a portfolio containing the author's coding work) featuring at least three examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks.

* Updated GithHub profile with pinned repositories featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks.

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile
